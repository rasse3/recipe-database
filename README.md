# recipe-database

This application will allow people to find recipes according to ingredients, which may be either chosen freely or they can be automatically read from the user's personal "closet", which indicates what ingredients the user has and optionally the amounts too (no set amount will count as infinite amount). Recipes can also be searched by style, origin or name. Recipes will include starters, mains, drinks, desserts etc. Recipes can also be searched from other user's favourites or by amount of people who have favorited recipes (for example user may search for most popular dessert). The program will allow searches with multiple inputs. The list of recipes can be organized by name, type etc. Finally the user may mark favorite recipes, create own recipes and post them for others, edit their own closet and post suggestions for new ingredients.
